<p>Some days ago I realized that when a message is created through the Admin Console the Queue parameters set to use an Error Destination do not override the messageâ€™s parameters, it made me lose time because I thought that my application had a problem. However, the problem was caused because the â€œRedelivery Limitâ€ set on the message by the Admin Console was no overwritten by the â€œRedelivery Limitâ€ set in the Queue.</p>
