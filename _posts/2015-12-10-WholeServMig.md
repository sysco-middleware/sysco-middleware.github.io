## Whole Server Migration ##

This document shows two ways to configure whole server migration, using non-database consensus leasing and using database leasing. Something I have seen during my experience as a Weblogic Administrator is that even though many businesses have the resources to execute this configuration, they do not use it because of the lack of documentation, experience or since many people do not know its advantages.
You should test and use this configuration since it is a valuable method to reduce the impact of incidents on production environments and as can be seen it is not so complex.

You can download the guide using the following link.
