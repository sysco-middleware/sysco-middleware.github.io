I've had the opportunity to present a review of the book [Applied SOA Patterns on the Oracle Platform](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/applied-soa-patterns-oracle-platform).

Once I started to read the chapters, I found it quite interesting because of these:

* Great introduction to SOA principles, and Oracle SOA Suite evolution
* Align AIA Concepts with SOA patterns
* A key topic for SOA success: Service Repository
* An extensive and complete description of Security and Error Handling

It looks like a really long book (572 pages), and it is. But this is justified because it takes a great approach from concepts to examples combined with experiences and source code. This could help you to feel more confident about your SOA design decisions.
