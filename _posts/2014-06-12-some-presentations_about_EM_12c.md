We recently had presentations about Enterprise Manager 12c “Deep Dive” in Oslo and Bergen together with Oracle.

Here are to presentations I had about how you can install Enterprise Manager 12c, and how you can maintain it by patching the different components. I hope it might be useful for some of you.
