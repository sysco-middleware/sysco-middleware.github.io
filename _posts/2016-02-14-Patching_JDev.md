# Keeping your JDeveloper SOA/OSB Quickstart environment up to date
Oracle released new patches some weeks ago, and to keep your JDeveloper updated for SOA Suite and Oracle Service Bus there are three products you should patch:

* Oracle SOA Suite
* Oracle Service Bus
* Weblogic

When you search My Oracle Support (MOS) for patches - you can see which ones are the recommended ones. There are also notes in MOS which are updated regularly:

* OSB 11g and 12c: Bundle Patch Reference (Doc ID 1499170.1)
* SOA 11g and 12c: Bundle Patch Reference (Doc ID 1485949.1)
* Master Note on WebLogic Server Patch Set Updates (PSUs) (Doc ID 1470197.1) 

In the environment I used for this example. Patch 19707784: SOA Bundle Patch 12.1.3.0.1 was applied before. This will be detected by OPatch, and that patch will be rolled back.

The patching is simplified in the 12c-version, because now there is only one OPatch-folder to care about (in version 11 there were one per product). You can read more about it here: [Oracle Documentation link](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/core/OPATC/toc.htm#OPATC101)

For each patch there is a README.txt, whick you should read. It contains Pre-Installation Instructions, Install and Post-Instructions. For the SOA-patch, you should look through the steps for  the Post-steps

I use Windows environment in this example, so I set the environment variables first (run as Administrator):

```bash
SET ORACLE_HOME=D:\Oracle\Middleware1213\Oracle_Home

SET PATH=%PATH%;%ORACLE_HOME%\OPatch
```

You can verify existing patches using:

```bash
opatch lspatches
```

# Weblogic

For Weblogic I have updated to: WLS PATCH SET UPDATE 12.1.3.0.6. The WLS patch applied has patch number: 21983457. You download the file p21983457_121300_Generic.zip to any directory on your file system - go to that directory, and apply using the command "opatch apply".

```bash

# Oracle SOA Suite

For Oracle SOA Suite there has been many updates, the latest one is - 12.1.3.0.5. In the patch process, it is identified that an older patch should be rolled back before the new one is applied. The SOA patch applied has patch number: 22524811.

If OPatch returns a message that this patch conflicts with a previous Bundle Patch, allow OPatch to perform the rollback and install this one. If the conflict is reported for some other patch you have installed, make note of it and contact Support.

After successful patching you cold verify:

```bash

```

According to MOS Note Doc ID 1485949.1 it is recommended that the first time you start JDeveloper after applying the patch that you use the '-clean' option to clear any residual cache. From the same note:

2. Backup and clean out the server tmp, cache, stage and dc folders before restarting the servers to refresh the runtime libraries

There are also 2 more notes, but I am not sure if this is relevant on 12 (was on 11)
1. Apply the patch to both the SOA and oracle_common home
3. In development environments, check for JDeveloper extension updates with the built in utility under the Help -> Check for Updates option.

Note: BPM fixes are again merged with the SOA Suite fixes starting in this Bundle Patch.

If you want to look into the patch details - look at /etc/config/inventory.xml and /etc/config/actions.xml.
