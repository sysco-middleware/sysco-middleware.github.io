In Sysco we are currently focusing on certifications and spezialization. With the latest approvals, we now are specialized in:

* MySQL 5
* Oracle Database 11g
* Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c
* Oracle Linux 6
* Oracle WebLogic Server 12c
* Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud
* Oil and Gas

I have looked through the different certifications we have that are counting for specializations â€“ that means that all the 10g or older certifications do not count. We now do have certified people on:

* Oracle Application Grid 11g Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle Business Intelligence Foundation Suite 11g Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle Certified Associate, MySQL 5
* Oracle Certified Expert, Oracle Real Application Clusters 11g and Grid Infrastructure Administrator
* Oracle Database 11g Administrator Certified Associate
* Oracle Database 11g Administrator Certified Professional
* Oracle Database 11g Administrator Certified Master
* Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud 2014 Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle IT Architecture Release 3 Certified Architecture Specialist
* Oracle IT Architecture SOA 2013 Certified Architecture Specialist
* Oracle Linux 6 Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle Linux Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle Service Oriented Architecture Infrastructure Implementation Certified Expert
* Oracle Unified Business Process Management Suite 11g Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle VM 3.0 for x86 Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle WebCenter Content 11g Certified Implementation Specialist
* Oracle WebLogic Server 12c Certified Implementation Specialist

There is one thing I can promise, and that the two lists will grow.
